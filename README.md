This implementation focuses on the encoder-decoder framework, particularly employs a pre-trained ResNet-50 model as the encoder to extract high-dimensional feature vectors from the input images, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) equipped with memory cells as a decoder, to process these feature embeddings and sequentially generate coherent and semantically descriptive captions for the given images.
